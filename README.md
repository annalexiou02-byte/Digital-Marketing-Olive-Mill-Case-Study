**Academic Institution:** Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)
**Course:** Digital Marketing
**Academic Year:** 2022-2023


## 💡 Project Goal & Context

This project focused on developing and executing a comprehensive Digital Marketing strategy for the Meliadis Olive Mill, a business established in 1978 that previously relied exclusively on word-of-mouth and the local market. The company had a limited profit margin due to these shortcomings.

**Core Objective:** To immediately establish and promote the company's digital presence, transforming its complete online absence into a strong point and expanding its customer base.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis (SWOT Summary)

The strategic planning began with a SWOT analysis:

| Category | Key Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strengths** | Strong interpersonal contact with customers, high-quality raw materials. |
| **Weaknesses** | Complete absence of social media presence, small facilities limiting response to new customers, inability to manage supply chain for exports. |
| **Opportunities** | Exporting products to Northern European countries, attracting new customers via social media, acquiring advanced machinery for increased production. |
| **Threats** | Increased competitive pressure due to lack of digital channels, risk of bankruptcy due to capital shortage for customer acquisition. |

## 🛠️ Methodology and Implementation

The strategy targeted **consumers** (local and international) who are easier to reach through digital channels. The positioning focused on the **exceptional quality of the produced olive oil**.

**Implementation Actions (1-Month Campaign: May 10, 2023 – June 8, 2023):**

| Action | Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Website Development** | Weebly | Advertising services (not e-shop), aiming for high search engine visibility. |
| **Social Media Setup** | Facebook & Instagram | Creating a "casual environment" for followers to interact and stay updated. |
| **Paid Promotion** | Facebook Ads | Promoting the page and driving traffic/clicks back to the website. |
| **Paid Promotion** | Google Search Ads | Immediate attraction of interested parties using targeted keywords (disrupted). |

## 📊 Key Results and Performance Evaluation

The Google Ads campaign was severely impacted and ultimately **cancelled** shortly after launch due to "extensive use of capital characters", limiting its run time to only four days (June 7–11, 2023).

Despite the failure of the Google Ads channel, the social media performance was strong:

| Performance Indicator (KPI) | Set Goal | Result | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Website Visitors** | > 2,500 | **1,218** | **Failure** (Due to Google Ads disruption) |
| **Facebook Page Reach** | > 35,500 | **40,728** | **Success** (Exceeded goal) |
| **Link Clicks (from Facebook)** | > 700 | **1,337** | **Success** (Exceeded goal by 91%) |
| **Cost Per Click (Facebook)** | (N/A) | **€0.06** | Excellent low acquisition cost |
| **Unique Followers (Facebook)** | > 40 | **25** | **Failure** |
| **Google Ads Visits** | > 1,700 | **67** | **Failure** (Due to cancellation) |

## ✅ Conclusion and Future Recommendations

The Facebook platform proved to be the most useful tool for reaching the target audience and building stable relationships with them.

Based on the campaign's performance, the following next steps are recommended:

1.  **Increased Facebook Focus:** Prioritize and give greater emphasis to the promotion and engagement on the Facebook page.
2.  **Active Organic Presence:** Maintain a more active presence on other social media platforms, such as **Instagram**, as they are good channels for organic audience reach.
